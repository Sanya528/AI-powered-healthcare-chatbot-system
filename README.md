Project Overview

The AI-Powered Healthcare Chatbot is a web-based system that allows users to interact with a chatbot for instant healthcare guidance.

It predicts possible diseases based on symptoms using a Machine Learning model (Random Forest), provides preventive advice, and suggests nearby hospitals through an integrated location service.

The system also includes an Admin Module to manage disease datasets, retrain the ML model, and monitor user activity.
